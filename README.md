# Heliot: Hybrid emulation of learning enable IoT systems


**Heliot** is a framework to emulate different IoT scenarios. An Iot scenario in Heliot consists of sensors (both real and virtual), compute resources (cloud, cloudlet, edge devices, containers etc) running computation and a dynamic network topology. Heliot is in active development. 

<br />

To better understand the Heliot, let us consider an IoT scenario doing surveillance as follows.
